# Coding Challenge #3
 
This project is about a case related to creating a program that simulates the basic car functionalities such as accelerate and break. The main goal is to find the car's behavior depending on the actions taken in the two primary actions above. The project is divided into four different parts that represent the various actions that are happening. All the cars are constructed, and the brand and the vehicle's speed are measured in km/h. The second and third ones are about the acceleration and break actions; the acceleration is measured by 10 km/h, and the break is 5 km/h. The final one is about creating two examples of different cars to test the accelerations and break actions using the test data. This program focuses on implementing JavaScript to simulate two main actions that cars do daily.
